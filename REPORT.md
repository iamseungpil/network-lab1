# SDN Network Lab Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
Successfully analyzed and tested an SDN network implementation using Ryu controller with Dijkstra shortest-path routing on a 10-switch ring topology. The system demonstrates automatic rerouting capabilities when links fail.

## Key Findings

### 1. Architecture
- **Controller**: Ryu SDN controller with OpenFlow 1.3
- **Routing Algorithm**: Dijkstra shortest path using NetworkX
- **Topology**: 10-switch ring with 10 hosts (1 per switch)
- **Discovery**: LLDP-based automatic topology discovery

### 2. Functionality Verification

#### ✅ Normal Operation
- Ping connectivity works between all hosts
- Dijkstra algorithm correctly computes shortest paths
- Flows are installed dynamically based on traffic

#### ✅ Dynamic Rerouting
- Link failures are detected via OpenFlow port status events
- Controller automatically recalculates paths when links fail
- Traffic successfully reroutes around failed links
- When links are restored, optimal paths are recomputed

### 3. Test Results

| Test Scenario | Result | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| Adjacent hosts (h1→h2) | ✅ Pass | Direct path through s1→s2 |
| Opposite ring (h1→h6) | ✅ Pass | 5-hop shortest path computed |
| Link failure (s1-s2 down) | ✅ Pass | Rerouted via s1→s10→s9→...→s2 |
| Link restoration | ✅ Pass | Returned to optimal path |
| Multiple failures | ✅ Pass | Handled complex failure scenarios |

### 5. Execution Commands

**Start demo (automatic):**
```bash
./demo_dijkstra_routing.sh
```

**Start manually:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Controller
ryu-manager --observe-links ryu-controller/main_controller.py

# Terminal 2: Topology
sudo python3 mininet/ring_topology.py
```

**Test commands in Mininet:**
```bash
h1 ping h2              # Test connectivity
link s1 s2 down         # Simulate link failure
h1 ping h2              # Verify rerouting
link s1 s2 up           # Restore link
pingall                 # Test all paths
```

## Conclusion
The SDN implementation successfully demonstrates:
1. **Shortest path routing** using Dijkstra algorithm
2. **Automatic failure recovery** with dynamic rerouting
3. **Scalable architecture** supporting various topologies

The system is production-ready for educational and testing purposes, providing clear visualization of SDN concepts and routing algorithms.
